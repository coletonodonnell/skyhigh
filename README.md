## Project 3 from the M.A.P. Group 

This project is for COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms. The project requires the following tools and libraries:

- NodeJS
- Tableau
- Compiler that supports C++20, ideally gcc
- primesieve
- pqxx
- efsw

To build, run `./build.sh`, to launch run `./launch.sh`. Project is designed to run on Unix based systems. This project has been tested and confirmed to work on Gentoo Linux.

Please note that there is a limitation with Tableau that requires manual refresh, future iterations will remove Tableau and opt for a better visualizer, but within the context of this it works as a proof of concept.
